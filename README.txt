Q:	What is Zencode?
A:	Zencode is a flexible programming language without a formal syntax which interprets psuedo-code-like, 
	natural language into compilable python code (hopefully more languages coming soon).

Q:	How	does Zencode work?
A:	Simply type what you want Zencode to do. It identifies words that are designated as possible function words,
	and extracts those into a list where it analyzes possible code blocks that can be comprised of the given functions
	and arguments. In the case that there is ambiguity, Zencode can prompt the user for clarification.
	
Q:	Do you guys have a list of supported functions?
A:	I'll let you know when we finish ;)
